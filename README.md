Getting Started
===============

Background
----------

This book is being written using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).  I
chose this system after evaluating several others.  The main things I
liked about Sphinx were:

  * The numerous output formats it supports (HTML, ePub and PDF being
    the important ones.
  * The extensibility of the Sphinx system.
  * The fact that it supports internationalization.
  * The fact that it allows custom templates and CSS to be used.

Compilation
-----------

Sphinx is completely portable so in theory, it should be possible to
compile the book (especially the HTML version) under nearly any
operating system.  However, I only have experience compiling it under
Ubuntu.  So I will include instructions only for Ubuntu.

In order to install the complete set of tools required to compile the
book, just execute the following command in Ubuntu:

     % sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra python-sphinx
