# Documentation about the build process

## Step 1: Build Simulation Specifications

## Step 2: Build Simulation Results

## Step 3: Build JSON (used by site generator)

## Step 4: Generating Site

## Step 5: Generate PDFs

## Step 6: Generate eBooks

## Step 7: Generate HTML (deprecated, don't need this)

## Step 8: Deploying Site

I'm using `now` to do the site deployment. Much simpler than all that mucking
about with AWS S3, IAM, permissions, keys, _etc._
