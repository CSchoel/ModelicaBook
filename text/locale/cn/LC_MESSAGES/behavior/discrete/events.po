"In the first chapter on :ref:`basic-equations` we saw examples of how to "
"describe continuous behavior.  The equations introduced in that chapter "
"applied at all times and the solutions to those equations were always "
"continuous.  In this chapter, we discussed the various ways in Modelica to "
"describe discrete behavior.  Events are the root cause of all discrete "
"behavior in Modelica."

"Events are generated in one of two ways.  First, they can be generated by "
"conditional expressions.  In the first few examples in this chapter, we saw "
"that conditional expressions can trigger events.  If these conditional "
"expressions only involve the variable ``time``, then we call them \"time "
"events\".  The ``time`` variable is a built-in, global variable that is "
"treated as an \"input\" to all models."

"If events are generated because of conditional expressions that involve "
"solution variables, then we call them \"state events\".  The important "
"distinctions between time events and state events were discussed in the "
":ref:`first <cooling-revisited>` and :ref:`second <bouncing-ball>` sections "
"of this chapter, respectively."

"Conditional expressions can be created using the relational operators "
"(``>``, ``>=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``==``) and logical operators (``not``, "
"``and``, ``or``).  As we saw in our discussion of :ref:`no-event`, it is "
"possible to suppress the events generated by these conditional expressions "
"by surrounding them with the ``noEvent`` operator."

"Frequently, these event generating conditional expressions occur in the "
