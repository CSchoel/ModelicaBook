"By default, variables declared inside a model are assumed to be continuous "

":ref:`getting-physical`, it is also possible to add the ``parameter`` "

"Closely related to the ``parameter`` qualifier is the ``constant`` "

" qualifier also implies that the value of the variable is known *a priori* "

"in the fact that a ``parameter`` value can be changed from one simulation to"
" the next whereas the value of a ``constant`` cannot be changed once the "
"model is compiled.  The use of ``constant`` by a model developer ensures "
"that end users are not given the option to make changes to the ``constant``."
"  A ``constant`` is frequently used to represent physical quantities like "
