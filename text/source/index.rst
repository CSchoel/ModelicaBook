   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

   This isn't the design I plan on having for the real landing page.
   Ideally, I'd like to have the Table of Contents for the book
   organized into "parts", but it looks like I'll either have to
   handle code the landing page in that case or using something like
   "Beautiful Soup" to tweak the generated code.  But I have figured
   out how to get Sphinx to use different layouts for different pages.
