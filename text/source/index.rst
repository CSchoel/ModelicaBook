   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Modelica By Example
===================

.. todo::

   I suspect for the "landing page", I'll need to do a hidden
   `toctree` and then add a custom landing page with all the links.
   But I need to wait until the structure is stable.  This will allow
   me to identify the implicit partitioning of the chapters into parts
   (which is not reflected in the explicit structure) and allow me to
   include the sponsorship information.

.. todo::

   Add a dedication.  Not sure where it needs to go.
