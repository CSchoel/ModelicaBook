Thermal Control
---------------

In this chapter, we'll consider another system that includes a plant,
controller, sensor and actuator.  The application will be thermal
control of a three zone house.  The plant will be the house itself,
sensor will be a temperature sense and the actuator will be the furnace
in the house.  Using these models, we will explore a few different
control strategies.

We'll also follow the architecture driven approach to building the
system that we followed in the previous section.  However, we'll start
using one set of interfaces and then, after discussing their
limitations, restart taking a different approach that will provide us
with greater flexibility.
