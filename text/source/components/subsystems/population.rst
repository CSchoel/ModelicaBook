Lotka-Volterra with Migration
-----------------------------

In this section, we will once again revisit the Lotka-Volterra models
to understand how we can build on the work we've already done of
creating reusable component models.  We will now take the next step
and create reusable models of individual geographical regions (each
with the usual population dynamics) and then connect those
geographical regions together with migration models.
