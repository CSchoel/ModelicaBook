Dedication
**********

This book started as a Kickstarter project.  The idea of writing a
book and making it freely available, under a Creative Commons license,
was largely inspired by the writings and speeches of Cory Doctorow and
Lawrence Lessig.  Their message of sharing resonated very strongly
with me.  The Kickstarter project was successfully funded on December
4th, 2012 and my odyssey to create an entire Creative Commons licensed
book began.  If circumstances had been different, this book would
probably be dedicated to them for inspiring me to take on this
project.

But this book isn't dedicated to Cory Doctorow or Lawrence Lessig.
Instead, it is dedicated to **Aaron Swartz**.  On January 11th, 2013,
Aaron Swartz was found dead at the age of 26 years old.  Aaron
committed suicide because he was facing up to 50 years in federal
prison and a $1 million dollar fine for simply copying academic
journal articles.  At the time, I was vaguely aware of the Aaron
Swartz case.  It was one of those cases you read about where an overly
zealous young person commits an act of civil disobedience and winds up
attracting the attention of the authorities.  It was the kind of case
that you assumed would end with a slap on the wrist.  But it
**didn't** end that way.

When Aaron committed suicide, I learned more about the details of his
case.  Reading about the case, I was shocked at the conduct
of U. S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz.  I was ashamed at the behavior of the
federal government with respect to the Swartz case.  The irony of the
Aaron Swartz case is that he contributed to the development of the
Creative Commons License (the very license I had chosen for my book)
and he was convicted of "stealing" academic journal articles because
he felt that academic research should be accessible rather than locked
up behind corporate paywalls.  Making this book available under a
Creative Commons license was my small way of following his example.

Reading about Aaron's case didn't just make me sad, it made my
furious.  By all accounts, Aaron was brilliant.  At the age of 

Just as I was getting started with disseminating scientific knowledge
via Creative Commons, Aaron was be persecuted for the same goals.


Largely someone I aspire to be (brilliant, successful, leader, champion)

Accumulation of knowledge, not wealth
