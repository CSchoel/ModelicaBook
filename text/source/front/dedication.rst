This book started as a Kickstarter project.  The idea of writing a
book and making it freely available, under a Creative Commons license,
was largely inspired by the writings of Cory Doctorow and Lawrence
Lessig.  Their message of sharing resonated very strongly with me.
The Kickstarter project was successfully funded on December 4th, 2012
and my odyssey to create an entire Creative Commons licensed book
began.  If circumstances had been different, this book would probably
be dedicated to Cory Doctorow and Lawrence Lessig for inspiring me to
take on this project.

But this book isn't dedicated to them.  Instead, it is dedicated to
**Aaron Swartz**.  At the age of 14, Aaron participated in the
development of the RSS standard.  He went on to start his own company,
Infogami, that was eventually acquired by Reddit.  Along the way, he
worked on the Creative Commons License and fought against Internet
censorship.  He was altruistic and cared deeply about technology and
the future of mankind.  We was more concerned with accumulating
knowledge than he was with accumulating wealth.  He had countless
qualities that I admire and aspire to.  He was both brilliant and
successful and he had a passion for spreading information, protecting
online freedoms and fighting Internet censorship.  But on January
11th, 2013, **Aaron Swartz took his own life**.

Barely a month after the successful funding of my Kickstarter project,
Aaron Swartz was dead at the age of 26.  It is astounding what Aaron
managed to accomplish in his young life and it makes his death all the
more tragic to think of all the good he could have done with the rest
of his life.  If Aaron had died of some illness, that by itself would
have been tragic.  But he was driven to take his own life because he
was facing federal charges that could have put him in prison for up to
50 years.  He exhausted his fortune defending himself but he
ultimately grew weary of the fight.

Because his life has been chronicled by better writers who actually
knew him, I won't go into detail about Aaron's case except to say that
as a business owner, a researcher and a U. S. citizen I am thoroughly
outraged by the way he was bullied by federal prosecutors who were
determined to make an example of him.  Their motivations were not
driven by an obligation to protect and serve the citizens of the
United States but rather to make an example of someone who tried to
use technology to make a better world.  He was not a threat to anyone
except antiquated and outmoded business models determined to remain
gatekeepers over the exchange of academic knowledge.

This book is dedicated to Aaron Swartz in an attempt to keep his
memory and, more importantly, the things he stood for alive.  Over a
year has past since he died and now seems an appropriate time to
remind everyone not just of all the things he did for the common good,
but also the misdeeds of Carmen Ortiz and the U. S. Attorney General's
office in pushing him to the point of suicide.  Aaron may have been
overly zealous and he may have gone to far in pursuit of his
principles but he was an admirable person and he did not deserve to be
bullied the way he was by the U. S. government.

I hope Aaron is remembered as a hero and I hope the U. S. federal
government has learned a lesson from this case that people like Aaron
are the ones who need their protection.
